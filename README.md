SimSo - Simulation of Multiprocessor Scheduling with Overheads. <br />
SimSo is a scheduling simulator for real-time multiprocessor architectures that takes into account some scheduling overheads (scheduling decisions, context switches) and the impact of caches through statistical models. Based on a Discrete-Event Simulator (SimPy), it allows quick simulations and a fast prototyping of scheduling policies using Python.<br />

This resp comes from http://projects.laas.fr/simso/ <br />
Also from https://github.com/javipalanca/simso <br />
<br />
Import from simso_0.8.5. <br />
Then is modified for my research purpose.<br />
